## Introduction
I am a recent Cyber Security graduate with over five years of IT support experience, with a strong interest in security operations, threat detection, and defensive security across enterprise environments.

## Objective
To transition into a cyber security–focused role such as a **SOC Analyst, Cyber Security Analyst, or Security Engineer**, where I can apply hands-on technical experience, security best practices, and continuous learning to help protect systems, networks, and data.

## Core Skills & Practical Evidence

| Cyber Security Skill | Associated Project / Evidence |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Security Monitoring & Incident Detection | Deployment and configuration of **Wazuh SIEM** for log aggregation, alerting, and threat visibility |
| Network Security & Traffic Analysis | **Snort IDS/IPS** setup for packet inspection, rule tuning, and intrusion detection |
| Threat Analysis & Investigation | Log analysis, alert triage, and incident investigation using SIEM tooling |
| Endpoint Security | Experience managing **EDR solutions** and endpoint protection policies |
| Identity & Access Management | Active Directory, Azure AD / Entra ID, conditional access and least-privilege configuration |
| Vulnerability Assessment | Cloud-based penetration testing and remediation planning |
| Security Hardening & Mitigation | Defensive controls implementation following attack simulation and testing |
| Scripting & Automation | PowerShell and Python for administrative and security-related tasks |
