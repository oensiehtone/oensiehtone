## Featured Project  
# **Cloud Security: Penetration Testing Simulation**

A final-year cyber security project demonstrating practical offensive and defensive security skills through a full cloud attack simulation and remediation cycle.

### **Project Highlights**
- Built a nested virtualised cloud lab (**VirtualBox**) hosting **Proxmox VE** **Zentyal IAM**, **Nextcloud**, **Windows 10**, **Kali Linux**, and **Snort IDS/IPS**  
- Simulated a full **Man-in-the-Cloud (MitC)** attack, including token capture and API-based data exfiltration.  
- Evaluated defensive controls using IDS/IPS and log monitoring.  
- Performed a complete risk assessment, implemented security mitigations, and re-tested the environment.  
- Demonstrated both offensive techniques and defensive hardening.
