# Cloud Penetration Testing: MITC Attack Simulation

This project recreates a cloud-hosted environment to evaluate real-world security weaknesses and defensive mitigations.  
It simulates a **Man-in-The-Cloud (MiTC)** attack using a custom Proxmox virtual environment, Zentyal for identity and access management, and Nextcloud as the cloud storage platform.

The work is based entirely on hands-on testing carried out during my TM470 Cyber Security project.

---

## 1. Architecture

A virtualised cloud environment was created using Proxmox, hosting:

- **Zentyal Server** (Identity & Access Management)
- **Nextcloud Server** (cloud storage, token-based authentication)
- **Windows 10 Client**
- **Kali Linux Attacker VM**

This architecture allowed full control over the identity system, file sync engine, and user authentication flow — enabling realistic MiTC attack testing.

➡️ See: [01_Architecture](./01_Architecture/)

---

## 2. Setup and Configuration

The environment used:

- **Proxmox (hypervisor)**
- **VirtualBox** during early prototyping
- **Zentyal** for directory services
- **Nextcloud** for token-based file sync
- **Windows 10** with the Nextcloud desktop client
- **Kali Linux** for attack execution

➡️ See: `02_Setup_and_Configuration/`

## 3. Vulnerabilities and Attack Surface

The attack surface intentionally included:

- Weak IAM configuration
- Exposed SMB shares
- Token-based authentication weaknesses
- Insecure credential storage on the Windows client
- Misconfigurations in the cloud sync process

➡️ See: `03_Vulnerabilities_and_Attack_Surface/`

## 4. Penetration Testing

Testing covered:

- Enumeration and scanning
- SMB exploitation
- User token acquisition
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Data exfiltration using MITC techniques

➡️ See: `04_Penetration_Testing/`

---

## 5. IDS/IPS Testing

To understand detection capability, intrusion detection testing was performed using:

- **Snort**
- **Suricata**
- **Kali Purple IDS components**

➡️ See: `05_IDS_IPS_Tests/`

---

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

A full risk assessment was conducted, followed by:

- IAM hardening
- Stronger access controls
- Server configuration improvements
- Token-handling mitigation steps
- Post-mitigation evaluation

➡️ See: `06_Risk_Assessment_and_Mitigation/`

## 7. Reflection and Learning

This section summarises:

- What worked well
- Issues encountered
- What I learned
- Improvements made during testing
- Skills gained across offensive and defensive security

➡️ See: `07_Reflection_and_Learning/`

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical capability across:

- Cloud security  
- IAM configuration  
- Offensive testing  
- Defensive mitigation  
- Virtualisation  
- IDS/IPS evaluation  
- Incident analysis  

It represents realistic, hands-on cyber security work performed independently from scratch.
