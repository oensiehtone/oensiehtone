# 7. Reflection and Learning

This project provided end-to-end exposure to cloud security design, offensive testing, detection evaluation, and defensive remediation within a controlled environment.

## 7.1 Technical Growth

Through building and breaking the environment, I strengthened practical skills across:

- Virtualised infrastructure deployment (Proxmox, nested VMs)
- IAM configuration and troubleshooting (LDAP integration, role alignment)
- Service enumeration and exploitation (SMB, Hydra, Msfconsole)
- Post-exploitation tooling (Mimikatz, Meterpreter)
- Token-based authentication abuse (MitC simulation)
- IDS/IPS deployment and detection analysis
- Risk remediation and layered security implementation

The project reinforced how misconfigured identity systems and exposed services can lead directly to cloud compromise.

## 7.2 Key Lessons

Several important lessons emerged:

- Weak credentials remain one of the most significant attack vectors.
- Token-based authentication can be exploited if endpoint protections are insufficient.
- Detection without enforcement does not prevent compromise.
- Infrastructure stability is critical when performing realistic testing.
- Security improvements must be validated through re-testing, not assumed effective.

The iterative process of breaking, fixing, and re-testing strengthened both offensive understanding and defensive decision-making.

## 7.3 Professional Impact

This project moved beyond theoretical knowledge and into applied security engineering. It required:

- Research-led problem solving
- Technical troubleshooting under failure conditions
- Structured attack methodology
- Defensive control implementation
- Validation through repeat testing

The experience has reinforced my interest in security operations, threat detection, and defensive cloud security, while strengthening practical skills aligned with SOC and security engineering roles.
