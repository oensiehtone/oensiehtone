# Cloud Penetration Testing: MitC Attack Simulation

This project recreates a cloud-hosted environment to evaluate real-world security weaknesses and defensive mitigations.
It simulates a **Man-in-The-Cloud (MitC)** attack using a custom Proxmox virtual environment, Zentyal for identity and access management, and Nextcloud as the cloud storage platform. The work is based entirely on hands-on testing carried out independently during my TM470 Computing and IT project.#

## Ethical & Legal Compliance

This penetration testing simulation was conducted ethically and within a controlled environment using only fictitious data. All activities adhered to the following standards to ensure lawful, professional and responsible practice:

- **Computer Misuse Act 1990** – All testing was performed with full authorisation and within a defined scope.
- **Data Protection Act 2018 & UK GDPR** (Article 5 principles) – No real personal data was used, ensuring compliance with data minimisation, confidentiality, and integrity requirements.
- **BCS Code of Conduct** (2022) – Professional competence, integrity, and responsible disclosure were upheld throughout the project.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2023** (Relevant Annex A Controls) – Guidance relating to access control, cloud service use, information security policies, and vulnerability handling informed project safeguards.
- **Equality Act 2010** – Project outputs were produced using clear, inclusive language with consideration for accessibility and non-discriminatory practice.

This project is for educational purposes only and the results are restricted to authorised users.

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical capability across:

- Cloud security  
- IAM configuration  
- Offensive penetration testing  
- Defensive mitigation  
- Virtualisation  
- IDS/IPS evaluation  
- Incident analysis  

---

## 1. Architecture

A virtualised cloud environment was created using Proxmox, hosting:

- **Zentyal Server** (Identity & Access Management)  
- **Nextcloud Server** (token-based cloud storage)  
- **Windows 10 Client** (Nextcloud sync client)  
- **Kali Linux Attacker VM**  

This architecture enabled full control over identity, file sync, token storage, and attack behaviour—allowing a realistic MiTC simulation.

## 2. Setup and Configuration

The environment consisted of:

- **Proxmox** (hypervisor)  
- **VirtualBox** (early prototyping)  
- **Zentyal** for directory services  
- **Nextcloud** for token-based sync  
- **Windows 10 client** with sync configuration  
- **Kali Linux** for attack execution  

➡️ See: **2_Setup_and_Configuration/**

## 3. Vulnerabilities and Attack Surface

The deliberately vulnerable attack surface included:

- Weak IAM configuration  
- Exposed SMB shares  
- Token-based authentication weaknesses  
- Insecure credential/token storage on the Windows client  
- Misconfigurations in the cloud sync process  

➡️ See: **3_Vulnerabilities_and_Attack_Surface/**

## 4. Penetration Testing

Penetration testing covered:

- Service enumeration  
- SMB exploitation  
- User token acquisition  
- Privilege escalation attempts  
- MiTC-style data exfiltration  

➡️ See: **4_Penetration_Testing/**

---

## 5. IDS/IPS Testing

Intrusion detection testing used:

- **Snort**  
- **Suricata**  
- **Kali Purple IDS components**  

➡️ See: **5_IDS_IPS_Tests/**

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

A complete risk assessment followed by:

- IAM hardening  
- Stronger access controls  
- Server-side configuration improvements  
- Token handling mitigations  
- Post-remediation evaluation  

➡️ See: **6_Risk_Assessment_and_Mitigation/**
